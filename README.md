language-lsl
===

language-lsl is a package to provide syntax highlighting for the Atom text editor.

It is converted from the TextMate LSL language definition you can read about here: http://forums-archive.secondlife.com/54/ae/89389/1.html

I'm unable to find any attribution information for the TextMate bundle, though it seems to be maintained by Piedro Padar: https://my.secondlife.com/piero.padar

The conversion was performed with Atom's own TextMate bundle conversion tool: https://atom.io/docs/v0.137.0/converting-a-text-mate-bundle

It still needs a lot of love. :-)

Atom?
